## Purpose

This website designed as an open science showcase for recent work from the Co-Design Lab at UC Berkeley.  We have a [blog](/blog/) for news and [papers](/papers/) for recent research papers.

## Website Design

This site, and the vast majority of its source code, originated from [bedford.io](http://bedford.io) and the Bedford Research Lab. Additional inspiration was drawn from our colleagues at the [IDEAL lab](http://ideal.umd.edu/about.html) who have also implemented the same open source template.
