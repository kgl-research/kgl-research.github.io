The Co-Design Lab, in collaboration with [Prof. Magy Seif El-Nasr and Postdoctoral Scholar Murtuza Shergadwala from UCSC](https://web.northeastern.edu/guii/lab-members/), were awarded a CITRIS Seed Award for our project titled "Integrating Theory of Mind in AI Models: Strategy Discovery from Human Behavioral Data".

ABSTRACT: As AI becomes integrated into systems used in our everyday life, new models integrating humanistic abilities become important. This project aims to develop a clear way to represent behavioral data in computational models. The overarching research goal is to develop a novel human-in-the-loop approach that integrates qualitative and quantitative inputs from humans into the computational process of modeling intent, strategies, and tactics as a graphical probabilistic model. CITRIS Seed Funding will support the first step: developing a novel language for representing complex dynamic behaviors, allowing experts to systematically and reliably model and update such behaviors based on human inputs.
