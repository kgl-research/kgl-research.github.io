The Co-Design Lab has been awarded a 1 year project through the AFOSR Trusted AI Challenge Series. This project is in collaboration with Prof. Jon Cagan at Carnegie Mellon. Read the project abstract below:

Abstract: Our team has developed an adaptive model of human trust in collaborating AI teammates, that is a dynamic entity which evolves over time and experience. Our work under the Trusted AI Challenge Series, will model the bi-directional trust between collaborating human and AI teammates and study the evolution of trust when members of the team have different and competing objectives. Our test scenario involves a drone design platform developed under DARPAâ€™s ATeams program, allowing heterogenous AI/human hybrid teams to engage in the configuration design of a drone. Following the 1-year funding period we will deliver: (1) a modified problem-solving drone design platform with tunable AI agents and integrated dynamic trust models; and (2) an updated human-AI trust model extended to be bi-directional and to three agents.
