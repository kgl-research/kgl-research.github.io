Yakira gave her PhD seminar talk titled "An Exploration of the Sociotechnical Factors Impacting Design Decisions" (abstract below) and will be joining MIT as a postdoctoral fellow.

ABSTRACT: 
Errors in design decision-making can manifest in many ways, from small misalignments in product affordances to large-scale system failures. In order to improve current design processes, this research aims to better understand the explicit and implicit sociotechnical factors impacting design decisions. The main research objectives were to investigate the impact of behavior and cognition on engineering outcomes, examine the effectiveness of design rationale documentation practices, and analyze the influence of power dynamics on design reviews. To comprehensively assess the impact of design decisions in engineering, quantitative methods (controlled experiments and computational modeling) and qualitative methods (document analysis, observations, and interviews) were utilized. This mixed-methods approach enabled a thorough investigation of convergent design processes among students and industry professionals. The results identified decision-making strategies that enhanced design performance, developed a framework to represent design rationale more effectively, and articulated the influence of power dynamics in industry design reviews. These contributions provide a transformative approach that empowers engineers to build more innovative and safer products, leveraging design methods and tools informed by a deeper understanding of sociotechnical factorsâ€™ influence on design.
