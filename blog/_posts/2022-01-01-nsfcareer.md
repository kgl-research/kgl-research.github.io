The Co-Design Lab has received an NSF CAREER Award! The five year project titled "Synthesizing Neuroimaging and Data Driven Approaches to Discover Inspirational Examples in Design" will seek to: (1) understand the behaviors and cognition that enable engineering designers to find and utilize inspiring examples in their technical work; and (2) use this knowledge to develop new data-driven tools to assist in the process of automated inspiration discovery. The education and outreach goals of the project are centered on the expansion of a 10-week summer program we developed at UC Berkeley to support underrepresented undergraduate students. Excited to get started on this project!
