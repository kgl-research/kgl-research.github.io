We are happy to welcome new visiting scholar Samuele Colombo, from Politecnico di Torino, who will be joining the Co-Design Lab for the next 6 months.

We also say goodbye to our departing visiting scholar, Shahroz Khan, from University of Strathclyde. Shah worked on a project centered around generative design with application in marine engineering. Safe travels!
