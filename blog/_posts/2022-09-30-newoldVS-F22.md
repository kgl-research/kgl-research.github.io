We are happy to welcome new visiting scholar Samuele Colombo, from Politecnico di Torino, who will be joining the Co-Design Lab for the next 6 months. Sam will be working on a project around converting neurophysiological and psychological findings during the conceptual design phase in order to support designers. Welcome to Berkeley!

We also say goodbye to our departing visiting scholar, Shahroz Khan, from University of Strathclyde. Shah worked on a project centered around generative design with applications in marine engineering. Safe travels!
