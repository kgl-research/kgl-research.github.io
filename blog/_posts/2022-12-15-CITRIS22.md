The Co-Design Lab, in collaboration with [Professor Zhaodan Kong at UC Davis](http://cphslab.com/), were awarded a CITRIS Seed Award for our project titled "Trust aware human-machine teaming using real-time neurophysiological data" in the "People and Robots" category. Special thanks to [Postdoctoral Researcher Mo Hu](https://codesign.berkeley.edu/team/mo-hu/) for leading this effort!

ABSTRACT: Trust is essential for effective collaborations between humans and machines â€” particularly those involving artificial intelligence. Misaligned trust can have terrible consequences, such as the car accidents caused by an overreliance on vehicle autopilot systems. This project will develop a real-time measurement of human-machine trust by recording physiological signals in the brains of experiment participants as they interact with high- and low-performing robots in a tool-sorting task. The participants will rate their levels of trust in the robots, and the research team will use the data to build and compare different trust-prediction models. This work will set the foundation for research on trust in more complex interactions between people and machines.
