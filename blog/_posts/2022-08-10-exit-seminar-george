George gave his PhD seminar talk titled "Sustainable and Inclusive Design Thinking" (abstract below) and will be joining MIT as a postdoctoral fellow through their [Engineering Excellence postdoctoral program!](https://engineering.mit.edu/the-mit-postdoctoral-fellowship-program-for-engineering-excellence/) 

ABSTRACT: 
Design thinking has become increasingly popular in academic, professional, and colloquial
communities as a means to address complex problems. In an era where responses to global
issues, such as the climate crisis, may have long lasting impressions on the human condition, it is
important that the methods for solving these problems are setting solid foundations for future
generations. This dissertation investigates sustainable and inclusive factors within the design
thinking process based on the premise that these are foundational elements of complex problem
solving. Holistically this dissertation studies how design thinking participants perceive success
and satisfaction in a design thinking experience. Also, this work includes a particular focus on
one of the more tangible stages of the design thinking process -- prototyping -- and uncovers
opportunities to improve sustainable practices through drawing insights about the current
vulnerabilities in the life cycles of prototyping and making. Key insights from this dissertation
include significant struggles at the beginning of the design thinking experiences compared to the
end of design thinking experiences (see Chapter 2 and Chapter 3) and suggests that demographic
background plays a significant role in how design thinking participants perceive success (see
Chapter 2). Notable takeaways about sustainable design thinking practices involve how the lack
of transparency in the manufacturing and distribution of needed materials and equipment make it
difficult for decision makers to prioritize sustainable, and even social, factors. Instead, cost,
availability, and quality remain driving factors for decision making. In addition, the driving
purpose for small scale fabrication spaces (such as community, project execution, or skill
building) was revealed as an influential factor in sustainable behaviors throughout all stages of
the life cycles of small scale fabrication spaces. Overall, future work that aims to reinforce
sustainable and inclusive practices in design thinking would benefit from investigating how
demographic context and motivation influence perceived value of, and observed behaviors
within, design thinking processes.
