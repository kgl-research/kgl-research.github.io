I am incredibly happy to share that I have been promoted to Associate Professor with Tenure in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley!

This would never have been possible without such an incredible group of students, postdoctoral researchers, visiting scholars, and collaborators who I was so fortunate to work alongside. It has been such a joy to interact with so many brilliant people and to bring our crazy ideas to life across 80+ publications and countless projects in our “intellectual lab compost.” I am deeply grateful to all of you for your trust, creativity, hard work, and partnership.

Onwards!
