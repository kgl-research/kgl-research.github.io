Members of the Co-Design Lab attended the 2023 International Conference on Engineering Design in Bordeaux, France this past week. Along with presenting their work, Elisa, Nicole, Ananya, and Kosa were able to meet many wonderful engineering design researchers from different countries, attend interesting talks, and reunite with visiting scholar Samuele!
