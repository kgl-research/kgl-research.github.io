# Abstract
Product recalls provide valuable insights into potential risks and hazards within the engineering design process, yet their full potential remains underutilized. In this study, we curate data from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalls database to develop a multimodal dataset, RECALL-MM, that informs data-driven risk assessment using historical information, and augment it using generative methods. Patterns in the dataset highlight specific areas where improved safety measures could have significant impact. We extend our analysis by demonstrating interactive clustering maps that embed all recalls into a shared latent space based on recall descriptions and product names. Leveraging these data-driven tools, we explore three case studies to demonstrate the dataset’s utility in identifying product risks and guiding safer design decisions. The first two case studies illustrate how designers can visualize patterns across recalled products and situate new product ideas within the broader recall landscape to proactively anticipate hazards. In the third case study, we extend our approach by employing a large language model (LLM) to predict potential hazards based solely on product images. This demonstrates the model’s ability to leverage visual context to identify risk factors, revealing strong alignment with historical recall data across many hazard categories. However, the analysis also highlights areas where hazard prediction remains challenging, underscoring the importance of risk awareness throughout the design process. Collectively, this work aims to bridge the gap between historical recall data and future product safety, presenting a scalable, data-driven approach to safer engineering design.
