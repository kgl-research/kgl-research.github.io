# Abstract

Throughout the design process, designers encounter diverse stimuli that influence
their work. This influence is particularly notable during idea generation
processes that are augmented by novel design support tools that assist in
inspiration discovery. However, fundamental questions remain regarding why
and how interactions afforded by these tools impact design behaviors. This work
explores how designers search for inspirational stimuli using an AI-enabled
multi-modal search platform, which supports queries by text and non-text-based
inputs. Student and professional designers completed a think-aloud design
exploration task using this platform to search for stimuli to inspire idea
generation. We identify expertise and search modality as factors influencing
design exploration, including the frequency and framing of searches, and the
evaluation and utility of search results.
