# Abstract
The successful adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled tools in engineering
design requires an understanding of designers’ mental models of
such tools. This work explores how professional and student engineering
designers (1) develop mental models of a novel AI-driven engineering design
tool and (2) speculate AI-enabled functionalities that can aid them. Student
(N = 7) and professional (N = 8) designers completed a task using an
AI-enabled tool, and were interviewed to uncover their mental model of the
tool and speculations on future AI-enabled functionalities. Both professional
and student designers developed accurate mental models of the AI tool, and
speculated functionalities that were similarly “near” and “far” in terms of
analogical distance from the AI tool’s functionality. These findings suggest
that mental models and cross-application of AI tool functionality are readily
accessible to designers, offering several implications for widespread adoption
of AI-enabled design tools.
