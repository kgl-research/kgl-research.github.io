# Abstract

Inspirational stimuli, such as analogies, are a prominent mechanism used to
support designers. However, generating relevant inspirational stimuli remains
challenging. This work explores the potential of using an untrained crowd
workforce to generate stimuli for trained designers. Crowd workers developed
solutions for twelve open-ended design problems from the literature. Solutions
were text-mined to extract words along a frequency domain, which, along with
computationally derived semantic distances, partitioned stimuli into closer or
further distance categories for each problem. The utility of these stimuli was
tested in a human subjects experiment (N = 96). Results indicate
crowdsourcing holds potential to gather impactful inspirational stimuli for openended
design problems. Near stimuli improve the feasibility and usefulness of
designs solutions, while distant stimuli improved their uniqueness.
