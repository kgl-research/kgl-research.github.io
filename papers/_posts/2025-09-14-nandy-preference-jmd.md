# Abstract
Abstract semantic attributes of designs (e.g., comfortable, luxurious, durable) play a significant role in the
assessment of user-facing products, capturing intangible factors that people may consider aside from performance requirements. However, due to the difficulty of mapping highly subjective and varying perceptions to
specific design features, it remains a challenge to quickly and accurately translate these qualities into designs
using computational design tools. Seeking to align computational and human representations of subjective
design information, we investigate the utility of adapting representations of semantic attributes to designersâ€™
perceptions through interactive models. A study is conducted in which users evaluate parameterized drinking
mugs, indicating their perceptions of how comfortable each is to hold. Interactive Bayesian optimization is
used to adaptively arrive at a design that optimizes this subjective quantity for each participant individually.
Participants (N = 31) guide the model by providing their own decisions or building off of empirical data
from a prior group of participants (N = 25). The resulting designs are evaluated across different scenarios,
demonstrating the extent to which outputs of non-interactive models can be used to represent a subjective,
semantic attribute and how interactive models may improve perceived alignment between human intent and
computionally-generated outputs.
