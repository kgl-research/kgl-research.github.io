# Abstract

Function drives many early design considerations in product
development. Therefore, finding functionally similar examples
is important when searching for sources of inspiration or
evaluating designs against existing technology. However, it is
difficult to capture what people consider to be functionally similar
and therefore, if measures that compare function directly
from the products themselves are meaningful. In this work, we
compare human evaluations of similarity to computationally determined
values, shedding light on how quantitative measures
align with human perceptions of functional similarity. Human
perception of functional similarity is considered at two levels of
abstraction: (1) the high-level purpose of a product, and (2) a
detailed view of how the product works. Human evaluations of
similarity are quantified by crowdsourcing 1360 triplet ratings
at each functional abstraction, and then compared to similarity
that is computed between functional models. We demonstrate
how different levels of abstraction and the fuzzy line between
what is considered “similar” and “similar enough” may impact
how these similarity measures are utilized, finding that different
measures better align with human evaluations along each dimension.
The results inform how product similarity can be leveraged
by designers. Therefore, applications lie in creativity support
tools, such as those used for design-by-analogy, or future computational
methods in design that incorporate product function
in addition to form.
