# Abstract

Despite the fact that inspirational stimuli (e.g., analogies) have been shown to be
an effective means to assist designers, little is known about the neurological
processes supporting inspired design ideation. To explore the impact of
inspirational stimuli on design ideation, an fMRI concept generation task was
developed (N = 21). Results demonstrate that inspirational stimuli of any kind
(near or far from the problem space) improve the fluency of idea generation.
Furthermore, neuroimaging data help to uncover two distinct brain activation
networks based upon reasoning with and without inspirational stimuli. We term
these inspired internal search and unsuccessful external search. These brain
activation networks give insight into differences between ideating with and without
inspirational stimuli, and between inspirational stimuli of varying distances.
