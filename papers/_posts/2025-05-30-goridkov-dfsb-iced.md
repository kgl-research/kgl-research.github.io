# Abstract	

Digital products and applications are rapidly evolving, offering immense potential to drive social change and encourage sustainable behaviors. This raises a critical question: how can we effectively design these products to support and inspire sustainable practices? This paper presents a literature review of design for sustainable behavior (DfSB) strategies across various digital and physical product-service systems in engineering design and human-computer interaction. The review examines DfSB intervention trends over the last decade, highlighting the increasing diversity of technological interventions, and categorizes the design methods employed in these technologies. These categories identify opportunities where future DfSB interventions can be applied and illustrate how the unique affordances of digital vs physical technologies can be effectively used to support sustainable practices.
