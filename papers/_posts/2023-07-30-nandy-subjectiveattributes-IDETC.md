# Abstract	

Subjective attributes play a significant part in the assessment
of user-facing products. Unlike performance requirements,
these quantities are best evaluated through human feedback.
While people share commonalities in their evaluations, allowing
personalization when quantifying these subjective attributes
may improve the alignment between computational and human
representations of design information. We investigate this topic
through a study in which participants (N = 56) make a series
of pairwise decisions between parameterized mugs, and indicate
their perceptions of how comfortable each is to hold. Interactive
Bayesian optimization is used to adaptively arrive at a design
that optimizes this subjective quantity. Participants guide
the model through only their own decisions or make decisions
using a model that has already been trained with simulated data
(N = 25) or data from the real decisions of other participants (N
= 31). The resulting designs are evaluated across the different
cases, showing the impact of capturing individual and aggregate
perceptions of subjective quantities. The findings imply that balancing
aggregate and individual-level decisions within models
simultaneously results in the best alignment with human perceptions
of subjective attributes. Further implications for design
include the potential for personalized control over subjective attributes
for designers, users, or users-as-designers.
