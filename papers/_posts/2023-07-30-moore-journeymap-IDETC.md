# Abstract

Practitioners' and students' experiences while engaging in
design thinking and human-centered design activities is well
understood to shape outcomes of those activities. However, an
understanding of the trajectory of experiences that
characterizes the design thinking process, and relates
experiences to outcomes, is still emerging. To contribute to this
knowledge area, we examine six student teams engaged in a
project-based learning course, and seek to understand each
participant and team's experiences with the design thinking
process across each design phase, through discrete
assessments, and holistically, through reflections on the entire
process: what we term journey mapping the students'
experiences. This approach reveals two preliminary findings
about the trajectory of novices participating in design thinking
work. First, we note that the beginning, research-oriented
phases of the design thinking process appear to offer a less
positive experience than later phases. Second, we note that
students of engineering and non-engineering backgrounds have
differing retrospective reflections on their design thinking
experiences. These findings suggest that deeper engagement
with particular design thinking phases, and an awareness of
disciplinary experience, can positively shape the experiences of
design thinking practitioners. Also, these results suggest that
the significant factors impressing upon a participant's design
thinking experience may change throughout the process.
