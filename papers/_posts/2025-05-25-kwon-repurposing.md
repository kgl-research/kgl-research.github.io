# Abstract	

This study presents an AI-driven method for generating preinventive structures - initial precursors to creative design concepts - using the Geneplore model as a theoretical framework. Multimodal AI is leveraged to derive preinventive structures from combinations of components of an existing product. This method is evaluated by comparing AI-generated structures of a product to those reverse identified from real repurposing solutions for the same product (IKEA hacks). The appearance of AI-generated preinventive structures in the repurposed designs suggests that this method can inspire and lead to viable design concepts. Implications extend to sustainable design, creative ideation, and the theory-driven development of design methods that support design in constrained solution spaces. Future work can refine these approaches and investigate broader applications in diverse design contexts.
