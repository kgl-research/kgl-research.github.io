Kevin is an MS/PhD student in the department of mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley. His current research interests are in understanding how humans and computer design tools interact with each other and exploring how emerging technologies, such as AI and virtual/augmented reality, can improve on engineering design tools. He graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin in 2022. Outside of the lab, Kevin practices in the sport of Olympic-style weightlifting and ballroom dancing, and he also enjoys going on long walks surrounded by big trees and mountains.
