I am an MS/PhD student in the department of mechanical engineering at UC Berkeley. My current interests include (but are not limited to) universal design,
human-machine collaboration for engineering design, and sustainability in product design. I graduated with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, working
on projects ranging from assistive technology to stretchable electronics, before moving back to the Bay Area. 
In addition, I am a former competitive figure skater, beginner guitar player, and coffee lover!
